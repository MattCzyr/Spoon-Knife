As I mentioned earier, I'm interested in working on some sort of web app (or
maybe a desktop app) that serves communities in some way. A couple years ago
I started an open-source project for a hackathon that simulates the effects of
natural disasters to determine safe evacuation routes for affected communities.
I may be interested in continuing that project. I think a common repository
would be the best choice for a small project like this with a handful of active
developers. It sounds like a blessed repository would be a better choice for
a larger project.
